1. Create an R markdown document to record what you are doing. Explain each step in words (don't forget to add session info!)
2. Download the samples data on the 1,000 genomes project from their website: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/20130606_sample_info.xlsx, (be sure to save the date you downloaded!)
3. Load and tidy each sheet of the spreadsheet using tools you've learned in this class. 
4. Merge all data sets into one tidy data set and save it as the processed data along with your script. 
5. Celebrate data collection and processing skillz!
6. Bonus kudos if you do it all in Github under version control
