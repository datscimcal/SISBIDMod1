## ImmuneSpace

[ImmuneSpace](www.immunespace.org) is the central database and analysis engine of the Human Immunology Project Consortium. It directly leverages the ImmPort database (more on this next)

### ImmuneSpaceR

ImmuneSpaceR is an R interface to interact with the ImmuneSpace database. The package is currently under development and will be released on `BioConductor` when the website becomes public.

## ImmPort

- Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort)
- Developed under the Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) funded by NIAID/DAIT
- Central data repository for NIAID/DAIT funded projects (as well as a few others)
- Established data submission processed that was leveraged by HIPC

## Requirements

ImmuneSpaceR requires the installation of two `BioConductor` package to handle
microarray data.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("affy")
biocLite("lumi")
```

The package as well as one of its dependencies are under development and available
from `GitHub`.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("cttobin/ggthemr") # Themes for ggplot2
install_github("RGLab/ImmuneSpaceR", quick = TRUE)
```

## Requirements

To access the password protected data, a `netrc` file is required.

- On a UNIX system this file should be named `.netrc` (dot netrc)  
- On windows it sould be named `_netrc` (underscore netrc).  

The file should be located in the users home directory and the permissions on
thefile should be unreadable for everybody except the owner. To determine home
directory, run `Sys.getenv("HOME")` in R. The following three lines must be
included in the .netrc or _netrc file either separated by white space (spaces,
tabs, or newlines) or commas.

## Connection object

ImmuneSpaceR creates object of class `ImmuneSpaceConnection` that can handle all
the data for an entire study.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ImmuneSpaceR)
sdy269 <- CreateConnection("SDY269")
class(sdy269)
sdy269
```

## Reference classes

`ImmuneSpaceConnection` objects use a different class system: Reference classes (or R5).

Reference classes are closer to classic OO systems like in Java or C#. They
are particulary useful to handle big data because the instantiated objects are 
**mutable**. This prevents R's copy on write mechanism.

Methods are called in a slightly different way:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
object$method(arg1 = val1, ...)
```

Additional info: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/R5.html

## Connection object: Data

```{r}
hai <- sdy269$getDataset("hai")
head(hai[, list(subject_accession, virus_strain, study_time_collected, value_reported)])
```

## Connection object: Data
The `quick_plot` method is used to quickly vuisualize the assay results.
```{r, dev = 'CairoPNG'}
sdy269$quick_plot("hai", color = "Age")
```

## Connection object: Caching
To avoid downloading big datasets multiple times, the connection object caches the
tables that have been fetched. Getting the same table a second time will be much
faster.
```{r}
head(sdy269$data_cache$hai[, 6:9, with = FALSE], 3)
```
Clearing the cache
```{r clear_cache}
# Clear the saved copy of the data and re-download it
hai <- sdy269$getDataset("hai", reload = TRUE)
# Clear ALL cached data in the object
sdy269$clear_cache()
```

## Connection object: Views

The 'full' view available online can be downloaded using the original_view argument
of the `getDataset` function.
```{r}
sdy269$getDataset("hai", original_view = TRUE)
```
All returned datasets are `data.table` objects.

## Gene expression data
ImmuneSpace stores raw and processed microarray data. 
```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Download a normalized gene expression matrix
EM <- sdy269$getGEMatrix("TIV_2008")
EM
```
Returns an `ExpressionSet` object (see the Bioconductor lecture).

## Differential expression analysis using limma 

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(Biobase) # To manipulate ExpressionSet objects
library(limma)
```
```{r DGEA, cache = TRUE}
mm <- model.matrix(~subject_accession + study_time_collected, EM)
fit <- lmFit(EM, mm)
fit <- eBayes(fit)
res <- data.table(topTable(fit, coef = "study_time_collected", number = Inf))
res <- res[!is.na(gene_symbol)]
res <- res[order(adj.P.Val)] # Order by increasing FDR
res[1:5]
```
The top five differentially expressed genes


# An example of cross assay analysis

## Getting datasets
```{r, cache = TRUE}
sdy269$listDatasets()
hai <- sdy269$getDataset("hai")
fcs <- sdy269$getDataset("fcs_analyzed_result")
elispot <- sdy269$getDataset("elispot")
```
## Summarizing information
We calculate HAI response as the max fold-change of any of the 3 virus strains
```{r}
hai <- hai[, hai_response := value_reported/value_reported[study_time_collected == 0],
           by = "virus_strain,arm_name,subject_accession"][study_time_collected == 28]
hai <- hai[, list(hai_response = max(hai_response)), by = "arm_name,subject_accession"]
```
Keep only the IgG for ELISPOT
```{r}
elispot <- elispot[, elispot_response := spot_number_reported+1][study_time_collected==7 & analyte=="IgG"]
```
Compute plasmablasts as percent of the parent population
```{r}
fcs <- fcs[, fcs_response := (as.double(population_cell_number)+1) /
             as.double(base_parent_population)][study_time_collected == 7]
```

## Combining assays
Merge all datasets in a single table.
```{r}
library(data.table)
setkeyv(hai, c("subject_accession"))
setkeyv(fcs, c("subject_accession"))
setkeyv(elispot, c("subject_accession"))
all <- hai[fcs, nomatch=0][elispot, nomatch=0]
colnames(all)
```

## Visualization: Flow cytometry vs. elispot

The figure below shows the absolute number of plasmablast cells measured by flow cytometry vs. the number of frequency of influenza-specific cells measured by ELISPOT. 
```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, dev='CairoPNG'}
ggplot(all, aes(x = as.double(fcs_response), y = elispot_response, color = arm_name)) + 
  geom_point() + scale_y_log10() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlab("Total plasmablasts (%)") + ylab("Influenza specific cells\n (per 10^6 PBMCs)")
```

## Visualization: hai vs. elispot

The figure below shows the HAI fold increase over baseline vs. the number of frequency of influenza-specific cells measured by ELISPOT. 
```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 4, dev='CairoPNG'}
ggplot(all, aes(x = as.double(hai_response), y = elispot_response, color=arm_name)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + scale_y_log10() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlab("HAI fold") + ylab("Influenza specific cells\n (per 10^6 PBMCs)")
```
